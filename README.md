This repository is created for the purpose of learning Git
I'm learning python for securing job in data science. Previously I have worked as mainframe developer and product manager.
I left my recent job due to personal reason. Now again i'm looking for job because I knew things will settle down and I will have to join back to earn my bread and butter
